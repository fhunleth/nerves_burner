         This is a good first image if you'd like to Nerves on a device. It
         sets up networking and an ssh server for remote access to an IEx
         prompt.

         All Elixir Circuits libraries are included for ease of trying out
         hardware programming using I2C, SPI, GPIOs and UARTs. It also serves
         as a known good image when debugging boot and hardware initialization
         problems.
