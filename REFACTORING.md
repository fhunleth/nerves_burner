# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring effort focused on simplifying the codebase by reducing duplication and improving maintainability, particularly around ANSI-formatted console output.

## Key Changes

### 1. New `NervesBurner.Output` Module

Created a centralized helper module for console output formatting with the following functions:

- `section/1` - Section headers (cyan, bright)
- `success/1` - Success messages (green, bright)
- `info/1` - Informational messages (cyan)
- `warning/1` - Warning messages (yellow)
- `error/1` - Error messages (red, bright)
- `menu_option/2` - Menu items with numbered prefixes
- `menu_option_with_parts/3` - Menu items with main and secondary text
- `prompt/1` - Formatted user input prompts
- `critical_warning/1` - Critical warnings with warning symbol
- `labeled/3` - Labeled output with customizable colors

All functions include proper type specifications (`@spec`) for better code documentation and type checking.

### 2. Refactored CLI Module

**Before**: 533 lines
**After**: 424 lines
**Reduction**: 109 lines (20% reduction)

Changes:
- Replaced verbose `IO.ANSI.format([...])` calls with concise helper functions
- Improved readability of menu rendering code
- Simplified error and success message formatting
- Reduced cognitive load when reading the code

Example transformation:
```elixir
# Before
IO.puts(IO.ANSI.format([:cyan, :bright, "Select a firmware image:", :reset, "\n"]))

# After
Output.section("Select a firmware image:\n")
```

### 3. Refactored Downloader Module

**Before**: 492 lines
**After**: 473 lines
**Reduction**: 19 lines (4% reduction)

Changes:
- Replaced repetitive ANSI formatting calls with Output helper functions
- Improved consistency of progress and status messages
- Cleaner error reporting

### 4. Overall Impact

**Total lines before**: 1290
**Total lines after**: 1252 (including new 100-line Output module)
**Net reduction**: 38 lines

More importantly:
- **Improved maintainability**: All output formatting is centralized
- **Better consistency**: Same visual style across all messages
- **Easier to modify**: Changes to output formatting only need to be made in one place
- **Better testability**: Output formatting logic is now unit tested
- **Enhanced readability**: Code is more concise and easier to understand

### 5. Testing

Added comprehensive test coverage for the new Output module:
- 13 new tests covering all Output module functions
- All 44 total tests pass
- Tests verify correct message content and formatting

### 6. Code Quality

- Added `@spec` type annotations to all public functions in Output module
- Code follows Elixir formatting standards
- Reduced Credo warnings related to code duplication

## Benefits

1. **DRY Principle**: Eliminated duplication of ANSI formatting code
2. **Single Responsibility**: Output formatting is now a separate concern
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Future changes to output styling only require editing one module
4. **Better Testing**: Output formatting logic can be tested independently
5. **Improved Readability**: Business logic is clearer without verbose formatting code
6. **Type Safety**: Type specifications catch errors at compile time

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further refactoring:
- Extract error handling patterns into helper functions
- Further simplify complex nested conditionals in Downloader module
- Add more unit tests for edge cases in CLI workflows
- Consider extracting device selection logic into a separate module

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully simplified the codebase while maintaining full backward compatibility and test coverage. The new Output module provides a clean, reusable API for console formatting that can be extended as needed.
