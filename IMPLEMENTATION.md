# Nerves Burner Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project implements a user-friendly Elixir script for downloading and burning pre-built Nerves firmware images to MicroSD cards, exactly as specified in the requirements.

## Requirements Met

### ✅ User Flow Implementation

The implementation follows the exact flow specified:

1. **Ask user to pick from firmware images** ✅
   - Circuits Quickstart
   - Nerves Livebook
   - Implemented in `NervesBurner.CLI.select_firmware_image/0`

2. **Ask user to pick from supported platforms** ✅
   - rpi0, rpi3, rpi4, rpi5, bbb, osd32mp1, mangopi_mq_pro
   - Implemented in `NervesBurner.CLI.select_platform/1`

3. **Download image from GitHub releases with progress** ✅
   - Downloads from latest release
   - Shows download URL and completion status
   - Implemented in `NervesBurner.Downloader`

4. **Call fwup to scan for MicroSD cards** ✅
   - Uses `fwup --detect` to list available devices
   - Shows device size for identification
   - Implemented in `NervesBurner.Fwup.scan_devices/0`

5. **Ask user which device or rescan, then burn** ✅
   - Interactive device selection
   - Rescan option available
   - Confirmation required before burning
   - Implemented in `NervesBurner.CLI.select_device/0` and `NervesBurner.Fwup.burn/2`

## Architecture

### Module Structure

```
lib/
├── nerves_burner.ex                  # Main application module
└── nerves_burner/
    ├── cli.ex                        # Interactive CLI interface
    ├── firmware_images.ex            # Firmware image configurations
    ├── downloader.ex                 # GitHub release downloader
    └── fwup.ex                       # fwup integration
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Modern HTTP Client**: Uses the `:req` library for reliable HTTP requests with built-in JSON support

2. **Escript Distribution**: Built as a standalone executable for easy distribution and usage

3. **Safety First**: Multiple confirmation steps and clear warnings before destructive operations

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

5. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into distinct modules for maintainability

## Technical Details

### CLI Module (`NervesBurner.CLI`)

- Main entry point via `main/1` function
- Uses Elixir's `with` construct for clean flow control
- Interactive prompts with validation
- Device size formatting for user clarity
- Confirmation dialogs for safety

### Firmware Images Module (`NervesBurner.FirmwareImages`)

- Centralizes firmware image configurations
- Defines available platforms for each image
- Provides asset name patterns for GitHub downloads

### Downloader Module (`NervesBurner.Downloader`)

- Fetches latest release from GitHub API
- Finds appropriate asset for platform
- Implements intelligent firmware caching:
  - Stores firmware in OS-appropriate cache directories
  - Verifies cached files using size and SHA256 hash
  - Automatically re-downloads if verification fails
- Uses `:req` library with built-in JSON support
- Computes SHA256 hashes in chunks for memory efficiency

### Fwup Module (`NervesBurner.Fwup`)

- Wraps `fwup` command-line tool
- Parses device information from `fwup --detect`
- Streams burn progress to console
- Proper error handling for missing fwup

## Building and Testing

### Build Commands

```bash
# Format code
mix format

# Compile
mix compile

# Run tests
mix test

# Build executable
mix escript.build

# Or use install script
./install.sh
```

### Test Coverage

- `test/nerves_burner/firmware_images_test.exs`: Tests image configuration
- `test/nerves_burner/fwup_test.exs`: Tests fwup integration
- All tests pass with zero warnings

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs:
- Code formatting check
- Compilation with warnings as errors
- Test suite
- Escript build verification

## Usage Example

```bash
$ ./nerves_burner

=== Nerves Firmware Burner ===

Select a firmware image:

  1. Circuits Quickstart
  2. Nerves Livebook

Enter your choice (1-2): 1

Select a platform:

  1. rpi0
  2. rpi3
  3. rpi4
  4. rpi5
  5. bbb
  6. osd32mp1
  7. mangopi_mq_pro

Enter your choice (1-7): 4

Downloading firmware...
Downloading from: https://github.com/.../circuits_quickstart_rpi5.fw
✓ Download complete: /tmp/firmware_rpi5_1696685943210.fw

Scanning for MicroSD cards...

Available devices:

  1. /dev/sdb (15.93 GB)
  2. Rescan

Enter your choice (1-2): 1

⚠️  WARNING: All data on /dev/sdb will be erased!
Are you sure you want to continue? (yes/no): yes

Burning firmware to /dev/sdb...
This may take several minutes. Please do not remove the card.

✓ Firmware burned successfully!
You can now safely remove the MicroSD card.
```

## Safety Features

1. **Explicit Confirmation**: User must type "yes" (not just "y") to confirm burn operation
2. **Device Information**: Shows device size to help identify correct device
3. **Rescan Option**: Can rescan if device not found initially
4. **Clear Warnings**: Prominent warning about data loss before burn
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for common issues
