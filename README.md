## Firmware Caching

Downloaded firmware is cached in OS-appropriate directories:
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/nerves_burner`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/nerves_burner`
- **Windows**: Local app data cache

Cached files are verified with SHA256 hashes before use. Invalid files are automatically re-downloaded.
