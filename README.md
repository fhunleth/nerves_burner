# Nerves Burner

A user-friendly tool for downloading and writing pre-built Nerves firmware images to MicroSD cards.

## Supported firmwares

* [Circuits Quickstart](https://github.com/elixir-circuits/circuits_quickstart) - Simple examples for GPIO, I2C, SPI and more
* [Nerves Livebook](https://github.com/nerves-livebook/nerves_livebook) - Interactive notebooks for learning Elixir and Nerves

## Installation

### Install Elixir

Please refer to the [Elixir installation docs](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

### Install fwup (optional)

Nerves Burner uses [fwup](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup) to unpack and write
Nerves firmware images to MicroSD cards. This is convenient but not required.
If `fwup` is not installed, Nerves Burner will provide step-by-step instructions for using alternative tools such as `dd` (on Linux/macOS) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (cross-platform) to write the firmware image to your MicroSD card. You do not need to install `fwup` if you prefer to use these tools.
For more information, see the [Etcher documentation](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher) or refer to your operating system's instructions for using `dd`.

Installation instructions are at
[github.com/fwup-home/fwup](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup#installing). If
you're using MacOS, just run `brew install fwup`.

### Download Pre-built Executable

Download the latest `nerves_burner` executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_burner/releases) page:

```bash
curl -L -o nerves_burner https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_burner/releases/latest/download/nerves_burner
chmod +x nerves_burner
```

## Usage

Run the executable:

```bash
./nerves_burner
```

GitHub hosts the firmware images and sometimes rate limits downloads. If you're
affected, let `nerves_burner` know your personal access token and it will log in
for the download:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
```
Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens (needs public repo read access only)
